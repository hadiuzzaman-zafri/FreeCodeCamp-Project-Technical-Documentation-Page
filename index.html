            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which 
                    was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system 
                    based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based 
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; 
                    that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special 
                    declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, 
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or 
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types 
                    are not explicitly typed.

            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" Java code:
                    <code>public class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                          System.out.println("Hello World");
                        }
                      }
                    </code>                
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.</li>
                    <li>The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename</li>

                <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
                <p>In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
                    <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
                    <li>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
                    <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
                    <li>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
                </ul>
                <code>String name = "John";
                    System.out.println(name);
                    int myNum = 15;
                    System.out.println(myNum);

                <ul>
                    <li>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value</li>
                    <li>Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_Comments">
            <header>Java Comments</header>
            <article>
                <p>Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.</p>
                <p>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).</p>
                <p>This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:</p>
                <code>// This is a comment
                    System.out.println("Hello World");
                </code>
                <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.</p>
                <code>/* The code below will print the words Hello World
                    to the screen, and it is amazing */
                    System.out.println("Hello World");
                </code>
                <ul>
                    <li>We use // for short comments.</li>
                    <li>And /* */ for longer.</li>

            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>A global variable is one declared at the start of the code and is accessible to all parts of the program. 
                    Since Java is object-oriented, everything is part of a class. The intent is to protect data from being 
                    changed. A static variable can be declared, which can be available to all instances of a class.
                </p>
                <code>class Grid{
                    public static float VerticalD(){
                        float ver = 1.55;
                        return ver;
                    }
                    }
                </code>
                <p>The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where we can access the variable. In its scope, we can edit, 
                    update, print, or copy the value of a variable. Global variables are the variables whose scope is the entire program. 
                    In other words, these variables are accessed from anywhere in the program.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value</li>
                    <li>You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later</li>

                <p>
                    Constant is a value that cannot be changed after assigning it. Java does not directly support the constants. There is an alternative way to define the constants in Java by using the non-access modifiers static and final.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Write the identifier name in capital letters that we want to declare as constant. For example, MAX=12.</li>
                    <li>If we use the private access-specifier before the constant name, the value of the constant cannot be changed in that particular class.</li>
                    <li>If we use the public access-specifier before the constant name, the value of the constant can be changed in the program.</li>

            <article>
                <p>As explained in the previous chapter, a variable in Java must be a specified data type:</p>
                <code>int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
                    float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
                    char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
                    boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
                    String myText = "Hello";     // String</code>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char</li>
                    <li>Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)</li>

                <p>In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text:</p>

            <article>
                <p>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
                    Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions. Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
                </p>
                <p>A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), 
                    but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:
                </p>
                <code>public class Main {
                    static void myMethod() {
                      // code to be executed
                    }
                  }
